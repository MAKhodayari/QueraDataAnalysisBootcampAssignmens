# Quera Data Analysis Bootcamp Assignments

Here you can find my codes and results for assignments and exercises that I had to do during the bootcamp.

## Structure

Each folder is represents one part of the assignments and inside each, there are different problems.

### 01. Statistics

This part is for statistical problems and works as an introduction to this field. I have used python to do what the assignment wants.

### 02. SQL

For database exercises, we had to write queries that were able to run on MySQL databases.
> **Note:** The **initial** database and **expected** results are not present yet.

### 03. Python

The last folder is for assignments targeting usage of python libraries such as **Numpy** and **Pandas**.
There is also another optional exercise for ***web scraping*** which has its own repository and it's not available here.
